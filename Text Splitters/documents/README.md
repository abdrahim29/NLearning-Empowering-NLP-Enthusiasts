# Pester

Pester provides a framework for **running unit tests to execute and validate PowerShell commands from within PowerShell**. Pester consists of a simple set of functions that expose a testing domain-specific language (DSL) for isolating, running, evaluating and reporting the results of PowerShell commands.

Pester tests can execute any command or script that is accessible to a Pester test file. This can include functions, cmdlets, modules and scripts. Pester can be run in _ad-hoc_ style in a console or **it can be integrated into the build scripts of a continuous integration (CI) system**.

**Pester also contains a powerful set of mocking functions** in which tests mimic any command functionality within the tested PowerShell code.
